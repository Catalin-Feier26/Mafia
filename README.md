# 🕵️ Mafia Game - Requiem Keepers

## 📖 Project Description
**Mafia** is a captivating social deduction game inspired by classics like *Werewolf*. The project blends strategic reasoning, collaborative decision-making, and logical deduction to create an engaging experience for players. With a narrative steeped in mystery and suspense, players are assigned unique roles such as **Civilians**, **Doctor**, **Police Officer**, and **Killer**. Each role contributes to the unfolding drama, where alliances are forged, secrets are kept, and truths are unearthed.

The primary objective of **Mafia** is to provide a platform where players can immerse themselves in a thought-provoking challenge, requiring them to interpret evidence, make alliances, and uncover hidden truths to achieve victory. The game is as much about storytelling and interaction as it is about logical reasoning and deduction, making it suitable for both casual play and intellectually stimulating engagements.

## 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide an interactive way to simulate and analyze social deduction gameplay using **Prover9**. The tool is used to decide if the final state of the game—whether the **Civilians** win or the **Killer** wins—is logical and makes sense, based on the collected evidence.
